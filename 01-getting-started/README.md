This repository contains example notebooks demonstrating how to use the Contextual AI Platform for creating and deploying generative AI agents. The examples focus on implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for financial use cases.

## Repository Structure

This repository includes two implementation approaches:
- [Quick-start.ipynb](quick-start.ipynb): Get started fast!
- [End-to-end-example.ipynb](end-to-end-example.ipynb): A complete walkthrough of a use case from creation to tuning.

The examples can be completed in under 15 minutes (excluding model tuning). Each notebook is self-contained and includes detailed explanations for each step.

For comprehensive platform documentation, visit [docs.contextual.ai](https://docs.contextual.ai/)

### Prerequisites

- Contextual AI Platform access
- Python 3.8+
- Python client `pip install --pre contextual-client`

### API Key

To use the notebooks, you will need an API key to securely access the API. To generate an API key, your admin can follow the process below:

1.   Log into your tenant at app.contextual.ai
2.   Click on "API Keys"
3.   Click on "Create API Key"
4.   Please keep your key in a secure place, and do not share it with anyone


## Use Case

These examples focus on creating a financial RAG agent that:
- Answers questions based on provided documents
- Avoids making forward-looking statements
- Handles financial data responsibly
- Provides accurate, document-based responses

Three data files are used in these notebooks, an ingested document, evaluation dataset, and a training dataset. These are toy datasets to illustrate the functionality of the platform.

- **Ingestion:** `Apple.pdf`

- **Evaluation:** `eval_short.csv`

- **Training:** `fin_train.jsonl`

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To quickly get started running the notebook we reccomend using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). If you'd prefer to run it locally, you can run in VS Code following these steps:

1. ðŸ“¥ Clone this repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ContextualAI/examples
    cd examples/
    ```

2. ðŸŒŽ Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv . && source bin/activate
    ```

3. ðŸ“¦ Install required dependencies
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. ðŸŽ®  Open the notebook in VS Code, click on "Select Kernel" (top right) -> "Python Environments" and select the newly created `venv` environment:

5. ðŸ”‘ Set up your API credentials in the respective [notebook](01-getting-started/end-to-end-example.ipynb)
    ```bash
    API_TOKEN = '...'  # Replace with your actual API token
    ```
