# Unit Testing with LMUnit: A Financial Services Case Study  

This repository contains an example notebook demonstrating how to evaluate LLM response quality using Natural Language Unit Testing. The approach provides a structured method for assessing generative AI outputs. The notebook applies unit tests for a financial services use case.

The notebook introduces LMUnit, a specialized model developed by Contextual AI that achieves state-of-the-art performance in response quality evaluation.

## Repository Structure

This repository includes one primary example:
- [lmunit.ipynb](lmunit.ipynb): A step-by-step notebook for using natural language unit tests for LLM response evaluation.

The notebook can be completed in under 15 minutes. 

## API Key

An API key is required for using the LMUnit model. You can request free access to LMUnit [here](https://contextual.ai/request-lmunit-api/).


## Notebook Walkthrough
This notebook guides you through:
 - Setting up the environment
 - Loading financial evaluation data
 - Designing effective unit tests
 - Running evaluations with LMUnit
 - Analyzing and visualizing results
 - Interpreting scores and improving LLM outputs
