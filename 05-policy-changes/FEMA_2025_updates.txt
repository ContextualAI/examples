Proposed V5 2025
Cost eligibility under the 2025 FEMA framework is determined through a comprehensive evaluation process that emphasizes both fiscal responsibility and effective disaster recovery. A major change to cost eligibility will be possession of FEMA ID number. Projects must demonstrate direct alignment with recovery objectives, with costs reflecting necessary work that is proportional to damage scale. Cost reasonableness is evaluated through detailed market analysis and industry benchmarks specific to project location and timing, while considering geographic variations, project complexity, timing constraints, and resource availability in the affected area.
All labor and equipment reimbursements must follow pre-established rates and policies, documented before disaster occurrence and applied consistently across operations regardless of funding source. Technical expertise requirements are assessed based on project complexity, safety considerations, and regulatory compliance needs, with all costs supported by thorough procurement documentation, clear scope alignment, and accurate time and material records. This streamlined approach maintains program integrity while providing the flexibility needed to address unique disaster recovery challenges across varying circumstances and locations.
