        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates how to use RAGAS to evaluate the quality of your Contextual AI's Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) agents. The purpose of this notebook is to show the flexibility of Contextual AI's platform to support external evaluation approaches. The approach shown here with RAGAS can be used similarly with other evaluation tools.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What is RAGAS?\n",
        "\n",
        "RAGAS is an open-source evaluation framework specifically designed for RAG systems. It provides several important metrics to assess the quality of both the retrieval and generation components:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Faithfulness** - Measures if the generated answer is factually consistent with the retrieved context\n",
        "2. **Context Relevancy** - Evaluates if the retrieved passages are relevant to the question  \n",
        "3. **Context Recall** - Checks if all information needed to answer the question is present in the context\n",
        "4. **Answer Relevancy** - Assesses if the generated answer is relevant to the question\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the key advantages of RAGAS is that it can perform reference-free evaluations, meaning we don't need ground truth answers to evaluate our RAG pipeline. This makes it particularly useful for evaluating production systems built with Contextual AI where labeled data may not be available.\n",
        "\n",
        "### In this notebook you will learn how to:\n",
        "1. Set up the RAGAS evaluation environment\n",
        "2. Prepare evaluation datasets\n",
        "3. Query a Contextual AI RAG agent and capture its outputs\n",
        "4. Calculate RAGAS metrics for your RAG pipeline\n",
        "5. Analyze and interpret the evaluation results\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's begin by setting up our environment."
