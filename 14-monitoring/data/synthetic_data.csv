However, according to the Amazon 10-K FY2024 report, the AWS segment's net sales for the year ended December 31, 2024, were $107,556 million.

To estimate the Q4 FY2024 AWS revenue, we can look at the AWS net sales for the first three quarters of 2024, as reported in the Amazon 10-Q Report FY2024 Q3:

* Q1 2024: $25,037 million
* Q2 2024: $26,281 million
* Q3 2024: $27,452 million

The total AWS net sales for the first three quarters of 2024 are $78,770 million. To estimate the Q4 FY2024 AWS revenue, we can subtract the total AWS net sales for the first three quarters from the total AWS net sales for the year:

$107,556 million (total AWS net sales for 2024) - $78,770 million (total AWS net sales for the first three quarters of 2024) = $28,786 million

Therefore, the estimated AWS revenue in Q4 FY2024 is approximately $28,786 million.",2025-08-05 06:17:28.884537,raj@rajivshah.com,thumbs_up,,,

From the provided documentation, we can find the following information:

* COGS for FY2024: $16,621 million (from Chunk 11, NVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries Consolidated Statements of Income)
* Accounts payable balance as of January 28, 2024: $2,699 million (from Chunk 1, NVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries Consolidated Balance Sheets)
* Accounts payable balance as of January 29, 2023: $1,193 million (from Chunk 1, NVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries Consolidated Balance Sheets)

To calculate the average accounts payable balance, we can use the following formula:

Average accounts payable balance = (Beginning balance + Ending balance) / 2
= ($1,193 million + $2,699 million) / 2
= $1,946 million

Now, we can calculate the accounts payable turnover using the following formula:

Accounts payable turnover = COGS / Average accounts payable balance
= $16,621 million / $1,946 million
= 8.54 times

Therefore, NVIDIA's accounts payable turnover in FY2024 is approximately 8.54 times.",2025-08-05 12:33:52.315337,raj@rajivshah.com,,,,

* Amazon: $30,425 million (Source: Amazon 10-K FY2023, Section: AMAZON.COM, INC. CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS)

To determine which company had the biggest growth in net income in FY2023, we need to compare the net income of each company in FY2023 to their net income in the previous year.

* Broadcom: FY2022 net income was $11,495 million (Source: Broadcom Inc. 10-K FY2022, Section: CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS). The growth in net income is $14,082 - $11,495 = $2,587 million, or 22.5%.

ROIC = Net Operating Profit After Taxes (NOPAT) / Invested Capital

First, let's calculate NOPAT:

NOPAT = Operating Income x (1 - Tax Rate)

From the provided documentation, we can find the following values:

* Operating Income: $32,972 million (from Chunk 1)
* Tax Rate: 12.1% (calculated as Income Tax Expense / Income Before Income Tax, from Chunk 1)

NOPAT = $32,972 million x (1 - 0.121) = $29,060 million

Next, let's calculate Invested Capital:

Invested Capital = Total Debt + Total Equity - Cash and Cash Equivalents

From the provided documentation, we can find the following values:

* Total Debt: $9,709 million (from Chunk 9)
* Total Equity: $42,978 million (from Chunk 3)
* Cash and Cash Equivalents: $7,280 million (from Chunk 3)

Invested Capital = $9,709 million + $42,978 million - $7,280 million = $45,407 million

Now, we can calculate ROIC:

ROIC = NOPAT / Invested Capital = $29,060 million / $45,407 million = 64.0%

Therefore, NVIDIA's return on invested capital in FY2024 is 64.0%.",2025-08-08 16:01:29.158016,raj@rajivshah.com,,,,

* Google Services: $121,263 million
* Google Cloud: $6,112 million
* Other Bets: ($4,444) million
* Alphabet-level activities: ($10,541) million

To calculate the operating income excluding Other Bets, we can add the operating income of Google Services, Google Cloud, and Alphabet-level activities:

$121,263 million + $6,112 million - $10,541 million = $116,834 million

Next, we need to calculate the total revenues excluding Other Bets. According to the provided documentation, the revenues for each segment in FY2024 are as follows:

* Google Services: $304,930 million
* Google Cloud: $43,229 million
* Other Bets: $1,648 million

To calculate the total revenues excluding Other Bets, we can add the revenues of Google Services, Google Cloud, and hedging gains (losses):

$304,930 million + $43,229 million + $211 million = $348,370 million

Now, we can calculate the operating margin excluding Other Bets by dividing the operating income excluding Other Bets by the total revenues excluding Other Bets:

($116,834 million / $348,370 million) x 100% ≈ 33.5%

Therefore, Alphabet's operating margin excluding Other Bets in FY2024 is approximately 33.5%.",2025-08-11 10:15:24.199614,raj@rajivshah.com,,,,

Free Cash Flow (FCF) = Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities - Capital Expenditures

From the provided documentation, we can find the following values for FY2024:

* Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities: $125,299 million (from Chunk 2)
* Capital Expenditures: $52,535 million (from Chunk 14)

FCF = $125,299 million - $52,535 million = $72,764 million

Next, we need to find the market capitalization (market cap) of Alphabet for FY2024. From Chunk 12, we can find the following value:

* Aggregate market value of shares held by non-affiliates: approximately $2.0 trillion (as of June 28, 2024)

Since the market cap value is not provided for December 31, 2024, we will use the value from June 28, 2024, as an approximation.

Free Cash Flow Yield = FCF / Market Cap
= $72,764 million / $2,000,000 million

Google advertising revenues increased from $237,855 million in 2023 to $264,590 million in 2024, representing a growth rate of 11.2% (=$26,735 million / $237,855 million).

However, to calculate the growth rate excluding foreign exchange impact, we need to consider the constant currency revenues. According to the documentation, total constant currency revenues increased by 15% year over year.

Since Google advertising revenues are a part of Google Services revenues, we can assume that the constant currency growth rate for Google advertising revenues is similar to the overall Google Services constant currency growth rate.

Therefore, the advertising revenue growth rate excluding foreign exchange impact in FY2024 can be estimated as follows:

Constant currency growth rate for Google advertising revenues ≈ 15% (similar to Google Services constant currency growth rate)

This estimate may not be exact, as the documentation does not provide a specific constant currency growth rate for Google advertising revenues. However, based on the available information, a 15% constant currency growth rate for Google advertising revenues is a reasonable estimate.",2025-08-12 10:36:03.762035,raj@rajivshah.com,,,,

1. Higher amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets from the VMware Merger, which increased by $1,850 million, or 133%, compared to the prior fiscal year.
2. Higher stock-based compensation expense, which increased due to annual employee equity awards granted at higher grant-date fair values.
3. Higher restructuring and other charges, which increased by $1,289 million, or 529%, compared to the prior fiscal year.
4. Higher interest expense, which increased by $2,331 million, or 144%, compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to interest on debt incurred for the VMware Merger.
5. A higher provision for income taxes, which increased by $2,733 million, or 270%, compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to the impact of a non-recurring intra-group transfer of certain IP rights to the United States as a result of supply chain realignment and the resulting shift in the jurisdictional mix of income.

Fulfillment costs for FY2024: $98,505 million (from Chunk 5)

Total net sales for FY2024: $637,959 million (from Chunk 5)

Number of orders is not directly provided, but we can estimate it using the average order value. According to the documentation, the average order value is not explicitly stated. However, we can use the total net sales and the number of customers to estimate the average order value.

Assuming an average order value of $50 (this is a rough estimate and may not be accurate), we can estimate the number of orders as follows:

Number of orders = Total net sales / Average order value
= $637,959 million / $50
= 12,759,180 orders

Now, we can calculate the fulfillment cost per order as follows:

Fulfillment cost per order = Fulfillment costs / Number of orders
= $98,505 million / 12,759,180 orders
= $7.72 per order

Please note that this calculation is an estimate and may not be accurate, as the actual average order value and number of orders are not provided in the documentation.",2025-08-13 22:58:57.743481,raj@rajivshah.com,,,,

From the provided documentation, we can find the following values:

* Total stockholders' equity at September 29, 2024: $26,274 million (Chunk 2)
* Intangible assets at September 29, 2024:
	+ Goodwill: $10,799 million (Chunk 11)
	+ Other intangible assets, net: $1,244 million (Chunk 11)
	Total intangible assets: $12,043 million
* Number of shares outstanding at September 29, 2024: 1,113 million (Chunk 2)

Now, let's calculate the tangible book value per share:

Tangible book value = Total stockholders' equity - Intangible assets
= $26,274 million - $12,043 million
= $14,231 million

Tangible book value per share = Tangible book value / Number of shares outstanding
= $14,231 million / 1,113 million
= $12.80 per share

Therefore, Qualcomm's tangible book value per share at the end of FY2024 is $12.80.",2025-08-14 12:10:38.992590,raj@rajivshah.com,,,,

To calculate the implied growth rate in Alphabet's cloud infrastructure investments, we can use the following formula:

Implied growth rate = (Current year's capex - Previous year's capex) / Previous year's capex

Using the provided data, we can calculate the implied growth rate as follows:

Implied growth rate = ($52.5 billion - $32.3 billion) / $32.3 billion
Implied growth rate = 62.5%

Therefore, the implied growth rate in Alphabet's cloud infrastructure investments based on capex in FY2024 is 62.5%.",2025-08-14 16:02:36.624695,raj@rajivshah.com,,,,
