    "# Contextual AI Multi-Turn vs Single-Turn Chat Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the difference between multi-turn and single-turn agents in Contextual AI by creating two fresh agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we're testing:**\n",
    "- **MultiTurnAgent**: Will be created with multi-turn enabled - should remember conversation context\n",
    "- **SingleTurnAgent**: Will be created with multi-turn disabled - should NOT remember previous messages\n",
    "- **Recurring conversations**: Can continue from a previous conversation using conversation_id\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test approach:**\n",
    "1. Create two new agents with different multi-turn settings\n",
    "2. Tell both agents some simple facts (favorite color and pet names) \n",
    "3. Ask if they remember those facts\n",
    "4. Test recurring conversation capability\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected results:**\n",
    "- MultiTurnAgent should remember facts across messages\n",
    "- SingleTurnAgent should forget facts between messages"
