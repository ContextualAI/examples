    "Contextual AI lets you create and run specialized AI agents that are powered by your data. This notebook introduces an end-to-end example workflow for creating a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent for a financial use case. The agent will answer questions based on the documents provided, but avoid any forward looking statements, e.g., Tell me about sales in 2028. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook can be run in under 10 minutes and covers the following steps:\n",
    "1. Creating a Datastore: this is where your documents live (unstructured data)\n",
    "2. Ingesting Documents: we will use a single PDF document but the platform is full scalable and supports HTML among other formats\n",
    "3. Creating an RAG Agent: all you need is a good system prompt to get started\n",
    "4. Querying an RAG Agent: answers based on your data and nothing more\n",
