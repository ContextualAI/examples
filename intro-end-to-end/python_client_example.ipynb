    "Contextual AI lets you create and use generative AI agents. This notebook introduces an end-to-end example workflow for creating a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent for a financial use case. The agent will answer questions based on the documents provided, but avoid any forward looking statements, e.g., Tell me about sales in 2028. This notebook uses the python client.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covers the following steps:\n",
    "- Creating a Datastore\n",
    "- Ingesting Documents\n",
    "- Creating an RAG Agent\n",
    "- Querying an RAG Agent\n",
    "- Evaluating an RAG Agent\n",
    "- Improving the RAG Agent (Updating prompt and tuning)\n",
    "\n",
    "With the exception of the tuning model, the rest of the notebook can be run in under 15 minutes. \n",
