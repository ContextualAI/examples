This repository contains example notebooks demonstrating how to use the Contextual AI Platform for creating and deploying generative AI agents. The examples focus on implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for financial use cases.

## Repository Structure

This repository includes two implementation approaches:
- [api_example.ipynb](api_example.ipynb): Direct API implementation
- [python_client_example.ipynb](python_client_example.ipynb): Python client library implementation

## Features

Both notebooks demonstrate an end-to-end workflow including:
- Datastore creation and management
- Document ingestion
- RAG agent creation
- Querying RAG agent
- Evaluation
- Further improvement (prompting and tuning)

## Quick Start

The examples can be completed in under 15 minutes (excluding model tuning). Each notebook is self-contained and includes detailed explanations for each step.

### Prerequisites

- Contextual AI Platform access
- Python 3.8+
- Required dependencies (listed in requirements.txt)

## Use Case

These examples focus on creating a financial RAG agent that:
- Answers questions based on provided documents
- Avoids making forward-looking statements
- Handles financial data responsibly
- Provides accurate, document-based responses
